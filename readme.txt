1. amend the PATH environment variable and add the path of the JDecafEditor folder

If, for example, the path is I:\mytools\JDecafEditor\ the following command needs to be
executed:

	PATH=%PATH%;I:\mytools\JDecafEditor\

2. execute the editor using the command javadecafe from any folder within your system
(note that this has to be done in the same session that changed the PATH variable)
